# Genetic-data-exploration

*Exploring and classifying genetic data.*

In recent years the size and quality of biological data sets have increased at a tremendous rate. It is fair to say that we 
have not yet reached the plateau of that development, so that students and researchers alike will be facing even larger data 
sets in the near future.

As the amount of information increases, so must the methods we use to explore, analyse and even present that data. 
The field of population genetics is undergoing a profound paradigm shift, as researchers move from exploiting the sparse, 
hard-won data sets of old to finding ways to understand and encompass the swaths of data their laboratories turn in. 

In recent years i have had the privilege of working on one of the largest genetic data sets to date (2018). In summary, this 
project involved the description of genetic structure across thousands of possible sites. I would like to leave 
here some of the more useful insight and tools that resulted. This repository consists in a series of Jupyter notebooks, 
each exploring some method or applications i found particularly useful.

Notebooks are organised in order of increasing complexity and, in most cases, of chronological development. This development was driven in 
greater part by the need to study the relation between statistcis that describe structure in data. Metrics to describe structure vary
across fields of research. Here, the focus is on the description of genetic data. 

Use NBviewer directly to explore the [notebook library](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SantosJGND/Genetic-data-analysis/tree/master/)

[NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) supports the 2D images produced in the scripts (copy-paste the url of a notebook onto the tab provided).

Not interactive plots however.
