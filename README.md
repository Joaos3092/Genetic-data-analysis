# Genetic-data-exploration
Exploring and classifying genetic data.

In recent years the size and quality of biological data sets have increased at a tremendous rate. It is fair to say that we have not yet reached the plateau of that development, so that students and researchers alike will be facing even larger data sets in the near future.

As the amount of information increases, so must the methods we use to explore, analyse and even present that data. The field of population genetics is undergoing a profound paradigm shift, as researchers move from exploiting the sparse, hard-won data sets of old to finding ways to understand and encompass the swaths of data their laboratories turn in.

In recent years i have had the privilege of working on one of the largest genetic data sets to date. I would like to leave here some of the tips and tricks i learned during this project. This repository consists in a series of Jupyter notebooks, each exploring some method or applications i found particularly useful.

[NBviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) supports the 2D images produced in the scripts.

Not interactive plots however..
